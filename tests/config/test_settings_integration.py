"""Integration tests for the complete settings system.

Tests the full integration of:
- DeepChainMapSettingsSource loading layered YAML
- Pydantic-settings merging env vars
- Settings class providing typed access
- Model identity resolution

Note: This file is a placeholder. Actual tests will be added in Phase 4
when Settings is refactored to use DeepChainMapSettingsSource.

# Tests will be added in Phase 4 when Settings integration is implemented.
# Placeholder tests were removed per testing policy (no trivial tests).
