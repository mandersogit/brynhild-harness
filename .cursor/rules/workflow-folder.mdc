# Workflow Folder Rule

## Rule: All AI-Generated Documentation Goes in `workflow/`

When creating documentation, plans, status reports, or tracking files, **always place them in the `workflow/` folder**.

### Files That MUST Go in `workflow/`

- Status reports and progress updates
- Development plans and roadmaps
- Architecture notes and design documents
- Task tracking and TODO lists
- Meeting notes or conversation summaries
- Analysis documents
- Any `.md` file that isn't a standard project file (like README.md)

### Correct Examples

```
✅ workflow/python-port-roadmap.md
✅ workflow/status-2024-01-15.md
✅ workflow/tool-analysis.md
✅ workflow/phase-1-notes.md
```

### Incorrect Examples

```
❌ PLAN.md (root level)
❌ STATUS.md (root level)
❌ notes.md (root level)
❌ TODO.md (root level)
```

### Exceptions (OK at root level)

- `README.md` - Standard project readme
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release changelog
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `LICENSE` / `LICENSE.md` - License file

### Why This Rule Exists

1. Keeps the project root clean and professional
2. All AI-generated working documents are in one place
3. Easy to find project context and history
4. Clear separation between project files and development artifacts
