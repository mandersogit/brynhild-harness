# Markdown Frontmatter Requirement

**All markdown files MUST begin with YAML frontmatter.**

## Required Format

```markdown

date: YYYY-MM-DD
status: draft | discussion | active | archived
---

# Document Title

Content starts here...
```

## Minimum Fields

- `title` — Document title (required)
- `date` — Creation date in YYYY-MM-DD format (required)

## Optional Fields

- `status` — Document lifecycle: `draft`, `discussion`, `active`, `archived`
- `author` — Who wrote it
- `tags` — Categorization tags as a list

## Example

```markdown
---
title: Template Wrapper Design
date: 2026-01-08
status: discussion
---

# Template Wrapper Design

This document describes...
```

## No Exceptions

All markdown files require frontmatter. No exceptions.

You might think that top-level files like README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md might be exceptions, but they are not. The github markdown parser should handle these fine with included frontmatter.
